/*! \file   osx_cahal.h
    \brief  Provides access at the top level (the device level) to the platform
            specific audio devices (both input and output). The exposed method
            cahal_get_device_list is defined in the implementation of this
            header in a platform specific way. The prototype however is defined
            in cahal.h, which is an exposed header file. The interface is
            platform agnostic even though the gathering of device information is
            platform specific.
