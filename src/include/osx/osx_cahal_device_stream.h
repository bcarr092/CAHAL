    \brief  Populate the list of streams supported by the audio device
            identified by the handle in io_device. The caller must free the list
            of streams. The list is null-terminated. Streams provide a direction
            and preferred format as well as supported formats to the caller as
            well as a handler to the stream.

    \param  io_device The streams supported by the audio device pointed to by
                      the handle in io_device will be queried and their
                      attributes including handle, direction and supported
                      formats will be stored in the list of streams in
                      io_device. This is a null terminated list and must be
                      freed by the caller.
    \return Either noErr(0) or an error code. The error code can be passed to
            printed for debugging purposes. Not the error code returned is a
            platform specific error code.
