    \param  in_recorder The caller-supplied callback to be called with empty
                        buffers that need to be filled.
    \param  in_callback_user_data The caller-supplied data to be passed back to
                                  the caller (unmodified) when their callback is
                                  called.
    \param  in_format_flags The flags to be used in the playback. Note that
                            these flags are converted back to the native OS'
                            flags. The most common reason why recording fails
                            is because these flags are incorrect,
                            i.e. unsupported.
    \return True iff playback has been start on in_device, false otherwise.
