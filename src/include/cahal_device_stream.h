/*! \file   cahal_device_stream.h
    \brief  All cahal_device_stream structs and typedefs are defined in this
            file. All functions related to the struct are also defined here.
            These are the platform-agnostic streams. A stream represents a
            single input or output stream. A device can have multiple streams if
            it supports both recording (e.g. a mic) as well as playback (e.g. a
            speaker).
